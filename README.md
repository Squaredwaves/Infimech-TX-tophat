Guida and BOM work in progress

Panel Dimensions: 318x328
                  324x70 - a hair under 70 is probably better

BOM: 

     60ish M3x8 bolts

     4x m3 nuts
     
     56ish m3 heatsets - not the cheap skinny ones
     
     2x m3x25 - for the hinges
     
     2x 20mm m3 5mm OD nylon spacers

     
Printed in ASA and TPU(for the front panel gasket)
Use a high enough infill and wall so as not to warp. Will make assembly very hard if it does.
